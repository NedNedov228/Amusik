MusicBot is a Discord bot that allows users to play music from YouTube in voice channels. The bot utilizes the discord.py library and the YouTube Data API to search for and play music.

## Features

- Play music from YouTube by providing the URL or search query
- Pause, resume, skip, and stop music playback
- Adjust the volume of the bot
- Display the currently playing song and the queue
- Support for multiple servers

## Usage

1. Invite the bot to your Discord server using the provided invite link.

2. Use the `.play` command followed by a YouTube URL or a search query to play music in a voice channel.

3. Use `loop {args}` to loop the music in the queue. For example: .loop one (loops current track) 

4. We are developing ther commands like `.pause`, `.resume`, `.skip`, `.stop`, and `.volume` to control the music playback.

For a full list of available commands, type `.help` in the Discord chat.
